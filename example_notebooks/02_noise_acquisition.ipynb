    "In this notebook, we will explore how to generate noise and acquire real interferometer output data. In GravyFlow, datasets are constructed through composition. By combining various elements, such as noise, injections, and conditioning, we can create customized datasets tailored to our specific needs. \n",

    "**Note:** The iterators demonstrated in this notebook are not necessarily recommended for use in training machine learning models. Even if you only require noise, without any injected signals, it is probably more convenient to use `gf.Dataset`, which will be explained in a later notebook. However, instances of `gf.Dataset` are composed by combining iterators of the type produced in this notebook with iterators shown in subsequent notebooks. Therefore, understanding the function of these iterators is useful.\n",

    "1. **Global Defaults**: Setting global defaults in GravyFlow for consistent parameters across our analysis.\n",

    "3. **Iterating Over Noise Samples**: Demonstrated the use of `gf.NoiseObtainer` as an iterator to generate multiple noise samples, ideal for batch processing or model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Multi-Interferometer Data Acquisition**: Showcased the capability to acquire noise data from multiple interferometers simultaneously, enhancing the depth of analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Visualization with Strain Plots**: Utilized GravyFlow's plotting capabilities to visualize onsource and offsource noise data.\n",

    "6. **Real Noise Data Handling**: Explored the use of `gf.IFODataObtainer` for acquiring real noise data, along with the handling of GPS times and segment pairing.\n",

    "In the next notebook, we will delve into the generation of gravitational waveforms. Building on the noise data acquired and processed in this notebook, we will focus on creating and injecting waveforms into the background noise. This process is crucial for simulating realistic gravitational wave signals and preparing datasets for tasks like signal detection and parameter estimation.\n",

    "We will explore various waveform models available in GravyFlow, understand how to parameterize these waveforms, and learn techniques for effectively injecting them into noise data. The goal is to create a robust and realistic dataset that mimics actual gravitational wave signals, paving the way for advanced analyses and model training."
