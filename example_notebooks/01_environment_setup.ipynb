    "For ease of use, GravyFlow includes a function, `gf.env`, designed to automatically configure the GPU environment.\n",

    "The `gf.env` function has the following optional arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `min_gpu_memory_mb` : int = 4000\n",
    "\t> Sets the minimum GPU memory (in megabytes) required for a GPU to be considered available for GravyFlow.\n",
    "- `max_gpu_utilization_percentage` : float = 80\n",
    "\t> Specifies the maximum GPU utilization (as a percentage) before GravyFlow disallows its use. The default is 80%.\n",
    "- `num_gpus_to_request` : int = 1\n",
    "\t> Determines the number of GPUs GravyFlow will try to find and use. The default is 1.\n",
    "- `memory_to_allocate_tf` : int = 2000\n",
    "\t> Sets the amount of GPU memory (in megabytes) that GravyFlow allocates per GPU. This value is fixed to ensure that CUDA functions run efficiently. Default is 2000 Mb.\n",
    "- `gpus` : Union[str, int, List[Union[int, str]], None] = None\n",
    "\t> Allows manual allocation on specified GPUs. This is not recommended unless necessary. If set to None, GravyFlow automatically selects free GPUs.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Function Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "When called, `gf.env` performs several operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identifies available GPUs with free memory exceeding `min_gpu_memory_mb`.\n",
    "2. Allocates a specified number of GPUs (`num_gpus_to_request`) for GravyFlow and cuPhenom, setting the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable accordingly.\n",
    "3. Checks for compatibility between the CUDA and TensorFlow versions.\n",
    "4. Allocates `memory_to_allocate_tf` Mb of GPU memory to TensorFlow per requested GPU.\n",
