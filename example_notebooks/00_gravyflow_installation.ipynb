    "# Notebook 00: Installation Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Clone the Repository\n",
    "GravyFlow can be installed by cloning the Git repository. Execute the following command to clone GravyFlow along with its submodules:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/mrknorman/gravyflow\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `--recurse-submodules` option ensures that the cuPhenom submodule and its submodules are downloaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Compile cuPhenom\n",
    "\n",
    "To compile the cuPhenom library, navigate to the cuPhenom submodule directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd gravyflow/cuphenom\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure the CUDA C++ compiler (`nvcc`) is accessible by updating your PATH variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin${PATH:+:${PATH}}$\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjust the path if your CUDA installation is in a non-default location. Afterward, return to the previous directory to continue the installation process:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd -\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Install Gravyflow\n",
    "It is recommended to install GravyFlow within a new conda environment. GravyFlow requires Python 3.10:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda env create --name gravyflow\n",
    "conda activate gravyflow\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, install GravyFlow and its requirements into your conda environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install -e gravyflow\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that GravyFlow is under active development, and you may encounter issues during installation. Ensure TensorFlow can recognize GPUs in your environment, as GravyFlow is optimized for GPU use and relies on vectorized GPU functions. Some components, especially cuPhenom, do not have CPU fallbacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Setup permissions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow these guides for setting up permissions to access real data:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://computing.docs.ligo.org/guide/auth/x509/\n",
    "https://computing.docs.ligo.org/guide/auth/kerberos/\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Setup Gravity Spy Permissions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Access Gravity Spy credentials by logging in with your LIGO credentials at:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://secrets.ligo.org/secrets/144/\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, export the obtained username and password:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "export GRAVITYSPY_DATABASE_USER=<user>\n",
    "export GRAVITYSPY_DATABASE_PASSWD=<password>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Test Gravyflow (optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "GravyFlow includes PyTest for testing its functionality. To run tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pytest gravyflow\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Tests may fail due to unavailable GPU memory if GPUs are currently under heavy use."
