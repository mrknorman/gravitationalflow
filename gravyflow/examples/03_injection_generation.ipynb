    "# Notebook 3: Injection Generation\n",

    "In this notebook, we will explore how to generate waveforms with GravyFlow, which can be used to approximate gravitational wave signals. Throughout the GravyFlow library, a significant amount of computation is performed on the GPU. This approach means that there may be some initial overheads compared to CPU calculations, so individual operations might perform more slowly. However, when used for thousands of iterations, GravyFlow methods are often orders of magnitude faster than the functions they were adapted from.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** As with the previous notebook, the iterators demonstrated in this notebook are not necessarily recommended for use in training machine learning models. Even if you only require waveforms, without any obfuscating noise, it is probably more convenient to use `gf.Dataset`, which will be explained in a later notebook. However, instances of `gf.Dataset` are composed by combining iterators of the type produced in this notebook with iterators shown in subsequent notebooks. Therefore, understanding the function of these iterators is useful.\n",

    "Currently, GravyFlow supports the generation of two waveform types: IMRPhenomD and White Noise Bursts (WNB).  We plan to expand this selection in the future. Both waveform types are generated on the GPU. IMRPhenomD generation utilizes the cuPhenom C library and operates using the CUDA library for GPU processing. On the other hand, WNB generation is integrated within GravyFlow and uses TensorFlow functions.\n",

    "It's important to note that cuPhenom is designed exclusively for GPU use and does not have CPU support. As such, attempts to run it on a CPU will fail. Additionally, cuPhenom has independent error-checking systems, which may raise errors or cause crashes outside of GravyFlow's control. These errors, often Out Of Memory (OOM) issues, will typically be indicated in the error message. Future enhancements are aimed at more robust integration of cuPhenom errors and improved memory management.\n",

In GravyFlow, injection padding is performed from the last sample of the generated waveform. For example, if front_padding_duration_seconds was 0.3 s, as is default, the last sample of the waveform cannot be less than 0.3 s from the start of the onsource segment. If the waveform is longer than the onsource duration, then the start of the waveform will be cropped and will not appear in the output tensor. If back_padding_duration_seconds was 0.3 s, then the last sample of the generated waveform cannot be within 0.3 s of the end of the onsource segment. If you wish to output waveforms in a fixed position with no random start time variance, set front_padding_duration_seconds = back_padding_duration_seconds = your desired last sample time in seconds.

    "To enhance the diversity of our generated dataset, we will now combine both the IMRPhenomD and White Noise Burst (WNB) waveform generators into a single `gf.InjectionGenerator`. This approach allows us to simultaneously generate a variety of waveform injections, each with its distinct characteristics. By doing so, we can create a more comprehensive and varied dataset, suitable for training robust gravitational wave detection models.\n",

For consistency, parameters for each waveform will contain entries for each entered type. If they are not used by that particular waveform, they will be set to zero. Let's proceed to set up this multi-type injection generator:\n"
